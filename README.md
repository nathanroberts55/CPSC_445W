# NRMediaSite
<h2>Project Background</h2>
	This project is essential because many professional creatives believe that the first step to having a successful 
	media company has a website. Also, many potential clients always ask to see previous work. Despite having accounts 
	on all prominent social media, having one place where customers can see all my previous work makes it a 
	one-stop-shop. Additionally, this site will allow clients to get in contact with me after reviewing my work quickly.
    Creating this site will be a great combination of all the skills, knowledge, and previous project experience
    that I have gained while at Christopher Newport University. First, all my coding courses gave me the proper
    foundation and understanding of any programming required for this project. Having classes like digital 
    media and web publishing prepared me for website creation and design. Then, other classes, like information
    systems design and implementation, and database management systems, gave me the knowledge and skills to
    properly create, populate, and utilize a database effectively. Finally, the cryptography & network 
    security course taught me how I would need to protect the customer and my personal information on my 
    website adequately.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
	When finishing this project, I would hope that it could accomplish a few tasks that would help promote my business 
	and take it to the next level. The intended users of this site will be me, clients, and potential clients. I would 
	use the page in order to exhibit my work, display my services, and contact/obtain new clients. Clients I would like 
	it to be an internet-accessible website with at least four main pages. The first of which would be the home/about 
	page, which would contain some basic information about myself and what the site provides. Next, there would be a 
	media page, where visitors can see examples of the different types of photos and videos that I have done for past 
	clients. Then a services page, where clients can see the different photo and video services I provide with 
	descriptions â€” finally, a contact page where potential clients can leave basic information and a description of 
	their project
